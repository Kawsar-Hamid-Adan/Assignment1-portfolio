                I personally have just one goal I want to achieve. Writing one piece of code that I come back to years
                later, and to think "cool, not too shabby".

                To reach there, I have to code and learn and code and every iteration I become a little better. That's
                the problem with reaching a certain level, it's not that easy to improve anymore.

                Here’s a time and a place for studying in groups, and sometimes it really is better to study by
                yourself. If you’re simply preparing for a short vocab quiz or something similarly small, there’s no
                need for a group study session.

                However, for larger assessments like midterms or final exams, study groups are awesome. See all the
                reasons listed above.

                On the other hand, unfortunely you have no friend. so no tension, google will be your honest and helpful

                    <li>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory
                        syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the
                        cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel
                        SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature.</li>
                    <li>
                        Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight. Like other enveloped
                        viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and
                        when the relative humidity is low (<50%). </li>
                    <li>
                        The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as
                        recently as 8000 BCE, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million
                        years or more, implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species
                    </li>
